# Basic implementation of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)

Basic implementation of physics-informed neural networks for solving several ordinary and partial differential equations. There
are 3 self-contained scripts in this repository:

* `logistic_equation_1d.py`: Solve the logistic equation in 1 dimension.
* `burgers_equation_1d.py`: Solve a simple 1-dimension Burgers equation with sinusoidal initial condition.
* `wave_equation_1d.py`: Solve the 1-dimension wave equation of a string clamped of both ends.
