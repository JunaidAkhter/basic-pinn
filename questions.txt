Questions about the code:

1. Why do we need to even minimize the boundary loss. Can't we enforce that the boundary conditions or is it important that we learn it.
2. In Burger's equation a regularization term is used while this is not the case with other equations. So how can one even decide how to use the boundary condition.
3. What is the term "initial_loss_df"? It has been used in wave-equation but not in burgers equation.
4.
